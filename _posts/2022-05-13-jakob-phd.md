The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for PhD positions in theoretical computer science and/or combinatorial optimization.

The PhD students will be working in the Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group headed by [Jakob Nordstrom](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se), which is active at both the University of Copenhagen and Lund University on either side of the Oresund Bridge.

The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting synergies often arise. Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, Groebner basis computations, integer linear programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical questions in computational complexity theory—though often with new, fascinating twists—but also involves work on devising clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in practice.

We are fortunate to be part of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU, which is world-leading in algorithms and complexity theory (currently ranked 6th worldwide by CSrankings.org). DIKU hosts the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre joint with the IT University of Copenhagen, and we also have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.

We currently have openings for both theoretically and practically inclined PhD students. There is a lot of flexibility as to what kind of research the PhD students will pursue, and all candidates are welcome, both those who want to go deep into either theory or practice and those who are inspired by the challenge of bridging the gap between the two.

These positions are available for period of 3-5 years, depending on the current education level of the applicant. All PhD positions in the research group are fully funded, employed positions (including travel money) that come with an internationally competitive salary. The starting date is negotiable but should ideally be in not-too-late autumn 2022.

The application deadline is June 29. Please see [the full announcement](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/PhD-UCPH-220629.html) with more information and instructions for how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to `jn@di.ku.dk`.

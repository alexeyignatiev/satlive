The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for several postdoc positions in theoretical computer science.
 
We are looking for outstanding junior researchers with an innovative mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and complement the research profile of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU. This is a world-leading research environment (currently ranked 11th worldwide by CSrankings.org in algorithms and complexity theory), with a strong presence at top-tier conferences like STOC, FOCS, and SODA, and also with publications in premier AI venues like AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS. We are home to the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre (barc.ku.dk), joint with the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While our focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
 
These postdoc positions are full-time research positions for an intended duration of two years. Teaching of advanced courses is encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and we are also receiving visitors from all over the world on a regular basis. The starting date is negotiable, but the default would be in August-September 2023.
 
The University of Copenhagen is currently expanding strongly in computer science. We expect to have tenure-track openings in in the coming years, and welcome postdoctoral researchers interested in exploring such opportunities.
 
The application deadline is January 10, 2023. See [the application web page](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/Postdoc-UCPH-230110.html) for more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and can be made to Mikkel Abrahamsen (miab@di.ku.dk), Jakob Nordstrom (jn@di.ku.dk), or Rasmus Pagh (pagh@di.ku.dk).

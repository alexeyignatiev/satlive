    ========================= CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS =======================
    QBFEVAL'22 - Competitive Evaluation of QBF Solvers
    
    A joint event with the 25th Int. Conference on Theory and
    Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT, affiliated with FLoC 2022)
    
    Haifa, Israel, August 2 - 5 2022
    
    ========================================================================

QBFEVAL'22 is the 2022 competitive evaluation of QBF solvers, and the
fifteenth event aimed to assess the performance of QBF
solvers. QBFEVAL'22 awards solvers that stand out as being
particularly effective on specific categories of QBF instances.


We warmly encourage developers of QBF solvers to submit their work,
even at early stages of development, as long as it fulfills some very
simple requirements. We also welcome the submission of QBF formulas to
be used for the evaluation. Researchers thinking about using QBF-based
techniques in their area (e.g., formal verification, planning,
knowledge representation & reasoning) are invited to contribute to the
evaluation by submitting QBF instances of their research problems (see
the requirements for instances). The results of the evaluation will be
a good indicator of the current feasibility of QBF-based approaches
and a stimulus for people working on QBF solvers to further enhance
their tools.

For questions, comments and any other issue regarding QBFEVAL'22,
please get in touch with the organizers via
`qbfeval@qbflib.org`. Details about solvers and benchmarks submission,
tracks, and related rules, are available on the [QBF evaluation 2022 web page](http://www.qbflib.org/qbfeval22.php).

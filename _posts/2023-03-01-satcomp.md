SAT Competition 2023 is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The competition is organized as a satellite event to the SAT Conference 2023 and continues the series of the annual SAT Competitions and SAT-Races / Challenges.
Objective

The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years. Many problems that seemed to be out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely. Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success. To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementers to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others. Researchers from both academia and industry are invited to submit their solvers and benchmarks.

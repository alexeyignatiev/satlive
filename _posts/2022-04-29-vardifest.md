The VardiFest titled "On the Not So Unusual Effectiveness of Logic" is a FLoC-22 workshop in honor of Moshe Vardi and is intended to celebrate Moshe Vardi's pioneering contributions that has enhanced logic's centrality in Computer science.

The workshop will be organized ala Highlights conference style: i.e., composed of short talks and invited talks.

This is a call for short talks (expected to be ~12 minutes). The proposal should be at most one page PDF in Easychair class style (https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors ). We will try to accommodate as many speakers as possible. Given the depth and breadth of Vardi's contributions that span across multiple fields of computer science and society at large, there is no definite list of topics of interest. We encouraged you to present a proposal for a talk that would be of interest to Vardi be it published or not, technical or non-technical, retrospective or crystal-ball gazing.

While we will give preference to in-person presentations, we will reserve a limited number of slots for remote presentations.

 

Deadline for Submission: May 15, 2022 AoE

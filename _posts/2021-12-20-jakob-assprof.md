The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for a tenure-track assistant professorship in computational complexity theory.

We are looking for an outstanding junior researcher with an innovative mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and complement the research profile of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU. This is a world-leading research environment (currently ranked 6th worldwide in algorithms and complexity by CSrankings.org), with a strong presence at top-tier conferences like STOC, FOCS, CCC, and SODA, and also with publications in premier AI conferences like AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS. We are home to the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre, joint with the IT University of Copenhagen, and have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.

The application deadline is January 30, 2022. See [the full announcement](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/AsstProf-UCPH-220130.html) for more information and instructions for how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to `jn@di.ku.dk`.

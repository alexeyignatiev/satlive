excerpt: ERC-Funded PhD and PostDoc positions available at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to join the proof logging revolution and make combinatorial optimizers deliver 100% correcntess guarantees. 
---

I'm looking for talented PhD students and PostDocs to join the CertiFOX project. The selected candidates will work on an exciting project in which we will bring certifying algorithms (proof logging) from low-level languages (such as SAT, where this approach is notoriously succesful) to high-level modelling languages. The grand goal we will work towards is to get end-to-end guarantees of correctness of runs of combinatorial optimization engines, all the way from human-readable input specifications to the produced answers. 

If this triggers your scientific curiousity, and you are (or want to become) a productive researcher in combinatorial optimization, have a look at the [the project webpage](https://bartbogaerts.eu/projects/CertiFOX) (under construction). 

These are fully funded positions that come with a very competitive salary or scholarship. The positions have an expected duration of 4 years for PhD students and between 1 and 3 years for PostDocs. The starting date is negotiable, but ideally this would be around the summer of 2024.
 
The application deadline is January 18, 2024.
PostDocs can apply [here](https://jobs.vub.be/job/Elsene-PostDoc-in-Combinatorial-Search-&-Optimization-%28Certifying-Algorithms-Proof-Logging%29/1006990301/) and PhD students [here](https://jobs.vub.be/job/Elsene-PhD-Scholarship-in-Combinatorial-Search-&-Optimization-%28Certifying-Algorithms-Proof-Logging%29/1006993801/)

I'm happy to answers questions there might be about these vacancies.

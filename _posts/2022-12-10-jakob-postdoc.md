The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen invites applications for postdoc positions in combinatorial optimization.
 
We are looking for outstanding junior researchers with an innovative mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and complement the research profile of the Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group headed by Jakob Nordstrom (www.jakobnordstrom.se), which is active at both the University of Copenhagen and Lund University on either side of the Oresund Bridge.
 
The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting synergies often arise. Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, Groebner basis computations, integer linear programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical questions in computational complexity theory—though often with new, fascinating twists—but also involves work on devising clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in practice.
 
We are fortunate to be part of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU, which is world-leading in algorithms and complexity theory (currently ranked 11th worldwide by CSrankings.org) and has a strong presence at top-tier TCS conferences like STOC, FOCS, and SODA as well as at premier AI venues like AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS. DIKU hosts the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre joint with the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), and we also have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Oresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
 
These postdoc positions are full-time research positions for an expected duration of two years. Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdocs will be expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the group also receives visitors on a regular basis. The starting date is negotiable, but the default would be in August-September 2023.
 
The University of Copenhagen is currently expanding strongly in computer science. We expect to have tenure-track openings in in the coming years, and welcome postdoctoral researchers interested in exploring such opportunities.
 
The application deadline is January 15, 2023. See [the application web page](http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/openings/Postdoc-UCPH-230115.html) for the full announcement with more information and instructions how to apply. Informal enquiries are welcome and may be sent to jn@di.ku.dk.

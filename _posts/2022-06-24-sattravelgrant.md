The organizers of the SAT conference 2022 and the SAT association would like to support members of the SAT community at large that have been impacted by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Therefore, we offer partial financial support for colleagues who as a result of the war do not have access to research funding to support their registration / flight costs to attend SAT 2022.

Interested community members should send a short informal application with a description of their situation, how much funding they would need and for which purposes to the treasurer of the SAT association

Stefan Mengel <mengel@cril.fr>

The deadline is July 8, 2022. The funding decisions will then be made by the board of the SAT association and the chairs of SAT 2022 shortly thereafter.

Please distribute this message widely to all those who might be interested.
